    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What is MBTI Media?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        MBTI Media is an app that recommends videos based on your Myers-Briggs personality type and current activity. It helps you find content that resonates with your cognitive preferences.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">How does the recommendation system work?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Our algorithm matches YouTube content to your MBTI personality type and chosen activity. Each personality type processes information differently, so we tailor recommendations to your unique preferences.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">What are the Premium features?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Premium subscribers can access the "Load 5 More" feature to get additional video recommendations and save videos to their Favorites list for easy access later.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">How does the free trial work?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        New users automatically receive a 7-day free trial with access to all Premium features. After the trial period, you can subscribe for $1/month to continue enjoying Premium features.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">How do I cancel my subscription?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can cancel your subscription at any time through your App Store account settings. Go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions, find MBTI Media, and tap Cancel Subscription.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">The app shows "Quota exceeded" - what does this mean?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        This means we've reached our daily limit for YouTube API requests. The app will automatically use cached recommendations or switch to offline mode. This limit typically resets within 24 hours.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">How do I change my MBTI type in the app?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can change your MBTI type anytime by tapping your current type in the top section of the home screen and selecting a different one from the dropdown menu.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">Can I use the app offline?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The app requires an internet connection to fetch new recommendations. However, your Favorites list is stored locally and can be accessed offline.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">I don't know my MBTI type - how can I find it?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        If you don't know your MBTI type, we recommend taking an online assessment. Several free tests are available online, such as 16Personalities.com or MBTIonline.com.
    </div>

    <h2>Privacy & Data</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What data does the app collect?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        We collect minimal data - only your selected MBTI type, chosen activities, and subscription status. We do not track personal information or browsing history.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">Where are my favorites stored?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Your favorites are stored locally on your device. We don't sync this data to the cloud or across devices at this time.
